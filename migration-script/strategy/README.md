## Functions and their usage:

The **getParams** function works as follows:

- It first prompts the user to choose a migration path (from XSA to CAP or from XSC to CAP) by responding with either 1 or 2. If the user's response is invalid, the process restarts.
- Then, the function prompts the user to specify the location of the CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model) project.
- Depending on the user's response to the first question (the migration path), the function asks the user to provide the location of the XSA/XSC project.
- The function then asks the user to provide the number of containers in the project. If the input is invalid, the process restarts.
- After that, the function prompts the user to name each folder that contains container data, as per the number of containers previously provided.
- Lastly, the user is asked to provide the name of the specific folder that contains the UI (User Interface) module in the XSA project.

The **setup_cap_project** function works as follows:

- Checks if the directory, given by the parameter CAP_DIR, exists or not.
- If the directory doesn't exist, it creates the directory, and all necessary parent directories, if required
- Changes the current working directory of the process to the CAP_DIR directory.
- Checks if a package.json file already exists in the new CAP_PATH.
- If package.json doesn't exist, it runs the shell command _cds init_, which initializes a new CAP project in the CAP_PATH by creating the necessary folder structure and files, including package.json.
- If a package.json exists, it logs a message saying that a new CAP project won't be created because package.json already exists.
- Finally, it changes the current working directory back to the parent directory.

The **mtaandxsuaa** function works as follows:

- This function executes the command cds add xsuaa in the CAP directory. This command is used to add User Account and Authentication (xsuaa) service configuration to the CAP project manifest.
- Next, the function executes the command cds add mta in the same directory. This command adds the Multi-Tenant Application (mta) model specifics to the CAP project.
- The function then checks if there exists a node_modules directory in the project directory. If there is no such directory, it logs a message indicating that the directory does not exist and needs to install node dependencies.
- Then it executes the npm install command in the same directory to install Node.js dependencies for the project.

The **setup_app** function works as follows:

- It appends /app to the CAP_DIR. This will be the directory in the CAP project where the UI artifacts will be copied to.
- It copies the UI artifacts from the source directory to the destination directory.

The **odataV2Support** function works as follows:

- The function executes the npm command _npm add @cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter_, which installs the OData V2 adapter package to the project's node modules.
- It also adds the _@sap/cds-lsp_ package, which is a language server for SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) projects.
- The function then reads the package.json file in the project directory and parses its content to a JavaScript object.
- If the cds field is not present in package.json, it adds this field and assigns it an empty object.
- It then sets values for cds.cov2ap, cds.cdsc, and cds.hana in the package.json.
- Finally, it installs two additional Node.js modules - _@sap/cds-dk_ and _@sap/cds-lsp_, which are necessary dependencies for an SAP CAP project.

The **buildTasks** function works as follows:

- It parses the content of package.json into a JavaScript object.
- If the cds field is not present in package.json, it adds this field and assigns an empty object.
- It then sets the cds.build field with an object containing target set as "gen" and an empty array tasks.
- For each db container, it creates a new task object with specific settings for HANA and adds it to the tasks array.
- It additionally adds a build task for the "nodejs" platform, specifically for the "srv" service module, with its model definitions in the "db", "srv" and "app" folders.

The **callcalculation** function works as follows:
- This function performs a series of operations on files based on settings from a configuration template file (*config.json.tpl*). 
The steps are as follows:
1. Changes the current working directory to *CURR_DIR*.
2. Reads data from the *config.json.tpl*.
3. Replaces the placeholder *{CAP_DIR}* in the read data with the *CAP_DIR* value.
4. Writes the updated data to a new *config.json* file.
5. Reads this new configuration file and parses its content as JSON.
6. Loops through each 'migration' item in the parsed JSON data. Each *migration* contains a list of *fileExts* and *strategies*.
   - For each file extension in *fileExts*, it uses the *glob* function to find all matching files in the *config.scanPath* and ignoring any paths specified in *config.ignorePaths*.
   - For each found file, it loops through each *strategy* in *strategies`. These strategies specify operations (or transformations) to apply on the file.
   - If *StrategyFactory* contains a strategy of the given name, it:
     - Reads the file's content.
     - Configures the strategy object with *strategy.config*.
     - Processes the file content using the strategy and gets the modified content.
     - Writes the modified content back to the original filename with an extra extension specified in *config.fileExt*.
   - If the *StrategyFactory* does not contain a strategy of the given name, it logs a message that the strategy was not found and skips the file.

The **formatcds** function works as follows:

- It initializes a configuration for format-cds, which is an npm package that is used to format CDS files. It executes the command _format-cds --init_ in the current directory, this creates the default cdsrc.json.
- Right after the initialization, it then calls _format-cds --force_ in the same directory. This means it will format all CDS files in this directory and subdirectories according to the rules established in the cdsrc.json configuration file, overriding any existing formattings.

The **compileAndRedirect** function works as follows

- It sets the srcPath and srvPath based on the value of the pattern it receives, representing paths where .cds files are located.
- It tries to compile source code in the srcPath using npx cds compile.
- For every redirection error, it finds services that caused the issue by extracting them from stderr using regular expressions.
- It then reads every .cds file in the 'srv' directory and for each error identified, it adjusts the corresponding line in the affected file, by adding or removing _@cds.redirection_.target as necessary.
- If it made any changes to these files, it saves them and tries the compilation again, calling the function recursively.

The **setup_db_containers** function works as follows:

- It takes several inputs, such as directories for the CAP and XSA, a number for creating extra containers, a parameter array and an options object.
- If CONTAINER_NUM equals 1, it prepares one database folder by copying contents from XSA directory specified in parameter array to a db folder in the CAP directory. If the number is greater than one, it creates multiple copies of the source folder in the CAP directory using the function `createFolderAndCopy`, each copy with a unique name.
- It executes the _cds add hana_.
- It calls the `createDefaultsFolderAndFiles` function which creates default folders and files inside the db/src/defaults directory, if they do not exist. Specifically, this function ensures two files: .hdinamespace and default_access_role.hdbrole in the mentioned directory with appropriate content. For default_access_role.hdbrole, it is also assured to have certain required privileges.

The process of setting up the db folder is defined in `setup_db`, which contains multiple functions

1. First step is to copy all the db files from source to destination using `copyDbFiles` function.
2. In the next step, the function `modifyHdiNamespace` reads each ".hdinamespace" file, parses its contents as JSON and updates the 'name' field to an empty string and 'subfolder' field to "ignore".
3. The function `convertHdbcdsToCds` converts all the _.hdbcds_ files to _.cds_
4. `calViewModification`

- It searches for all .cds files in the current directory and all its subdirectories.
- For each .cds file, it reads the content of the file and checks if there are any "using" statements that import a namespace (e.g., _using "namespace::EntityName" as EntityAlias;_ ).
- If such statements are found, it creates a new namespace by removing whitespace, replacing **.** and **::** with **\_** (underscore), and converting the whole namespace to uppercase.
- It writes a new .cds file with the name of the new namespace. The content of the new file declares an entity that already exists (non-existence is ignored), and specifies it as a calculation view.
- It replaces the original "using" statement in the original file to use the new entity from the newly created file.
- The original .cds file is then updated with the new content.

5. `modifyViewNotation`
6. `changeDataTypes` function finds all the .cds files and replaces certain data types like "LocalDate" with "Date"
   "LocalTime" with "Time"
   "UTCDateTime" with "DateTime"
   "UTCTimestamp" with "Timestamp" and
   "BinaryFloat" with "Double"
7. `removeDeprecated` function modifies all '.cds' files by replacing the term "temporary Entity" with "/_ temporary _/ Entity", effectively converting it to a comment and making it ignored during the code execution.
8. `replaceOdata` function updates .cds files by replacing usage of the `@OData.publish` annotation with the `@cds.autoexpose` annotation.
9. `moveToDB` function moves all the files ending with .cds to a folder inside db.
10. `removeGenerated` function goes through each file that ends with ".cds", removes all occurrences of 'generated always' (along with characters that might follow 'always' within the same line) and save the changes.
11. `formatRoleandTabledata`

- `deleteFilesEmptyFolders` function: if option equals 1, the function deletes files ending in ".hdbtabledata" or ".csv" and also removes empty directories in the specified directory (including .hdinamespace file and directory if present).
- It then collects all the files in the directory that end with the extensions ".hdbrole" or ".hdbgrants".
- If option equals 2, it further appends all files in the directory ending with ".hdbtabledata" to the list of files.
- For each file in this updated list, it reads the file content and parses it as a JSON object. These objects are then transformed based on specific conditions:
  - If the file ends with "default_access_role.hdbrole", it transforms the JSON data and if it includes the 'name' property under 'role', it assigns the original 'name' value to the transformed data.
  - If the file ends with ".hdbtabledata", it transforms all import file names included in the JSON data by removing the part before "::" (if present), then assigns the new transformed file names to the transformed JSON data.
  - If the file ends with neither of the above, it simply transforms the JSON data.
- The `transform` function converts all the keys to lowercase, and all the string values are converted to uppercase with "." , "::" and ":" replaced with "\_".

12. `formatSynonymConfig` function targets files with the extensions: ".hdbsynonymconfig", ".hdbsynonym", ".hdbroleconfig" or ".hdbsynonymtemplate".

- For each found file, it reads and parses the file content as JSON data.
- Each parsed JSON data is then transformed with the `transformSynonym` function. This transformation changes the properties' keys by converting them to uppercase and replacing any "." , "::" and ":" with "\_". For keys that are at the root of the JSON object, the key is transformed. But for nested keys, they are left untransformed. If a key named "object" has a string value, that string value is also transformed in the same way.

13. `processFolder` function

- `createhdbtabletype`: This function parses .cds files to identify table type definitions. If a table type definition is found, it collects column names and types to create a new table type in the "src/types" directory with a .hdbtabletype extension and inside it generates equivalent HDB Table Type. It replaces 'String' column types with 'NVARCHAR'. It also removes the table type definitions from the original .cds file.
- `checkAndDeleteFile`: This function checks if the file is empty after createhdbtabletype processing, if so, it deletes the file. It also deletes the files consisting of only empty context blocks.
- `processTableType`: This function generates HDB Table Type content using the given contexts, table name, and arguments that stand for the columns and types collected in the createhdbtabletype function. It then writes this content into a new .hdbtabletype file in the 'src/types' directory. It also prefixes with the uppercase last context name followed by "\_" if any contexts exist.

14. `replaceSimpleUsingInFiles` function

- Reads all the .cds files content, if any line of the file content includes "::", it skips current file and continues with the next file.
- Looks for all the lines that include using using a regular expression, where "using" is followed by a word (referred to as 'pack'), which might optionally be followed by 'as' and another word (referred to as 'alias').
- If it doesn't find an alias, it gets the last part of the 'pack' (split by ".") as the alias.
- It then replaces the original line with a modified line in this format: using pack as alias from 'pack[0]'. Here, 'pack[0]' stands for the first portion of the 'pack' when split by '.'. This implies the function replaces a non-local module import to a local import for '.cds' type files.

15. `replaceUsingInFiles`

- It uses a regular expression to match lines of specific patterns: i.e., lines starting with "using" followed by a string of characters that does not include a colon (::), then followed by '::', another string of characters that does not include a period (.) or newline(\n). Optionally, this can be followed by '.' and another sequence of characters that do not include newline (\n) or semicolon (;).
- These matched patterns are then replaced. If the optional sequence after '.' is present, the line is modified as using pack.context.attribute as attribute from './context'; Otherwise, it will be using pack.context as context from './context';. Here 'pack' is the first matched string, 'context' is the second match and 'attribute' is the optional last match.

16. `moveAndIndexCds`

- The function takes two arguments dir and newDir representing the source directory and the target directory, respectively.
- The function checks if the target directory exists or not. If it doesn't exist, it creates the directory.
- It reads the source directory and iterates over all files in the directory.
- During the iteration, the function checks if the file extension is ".cds". If it is, it moves the file from the source directory to the target directory.
- For each ".cds" file moved, it collects the base name (without extension) concat it with using from './cds/baseName';, and appends it to the content of a file named index.cds.
- After all ".cds" files have been moved and corresponding lines have been added to index.cds, it writes these lines to the index.cds.

17. `technicalConfig`

- The technicalConfig function scans all ".cds" files in a given directory and examines the 'technical configuration' blocks within these files.
- Depending on the provided option, it either removes certain blocks ('fulltext index', possibly 'column store' and 'row store') within the 'technical configuration', or if the 'technical configuration' block becomes empty, removes it completely. The remaining or full 'technical configuration' block is then modified to be a string annotated with @sql.append.

18. `structuredPrivilege`

- This function processes all ".cds" files in a given directory. For each file, it looks for 'define view' blocks that end with 'with structured privilege check;'.
- When such blocks are found, it moves 'with structured privilege check' part to a separate annotation line '@sql.append: 'with structured privilege check''. After this alteration, the function then writes the modified content back to the file.

19. `removeSeriesFunction`

- It uses a regular expression to match lines containing 'series' function with its arguments.
- Each found 'series' function call along with its arguments is removed from the text content.

20. `commentAnnotation`

- For each .cds file, it replaces every instance of a comment formatted as @Comment : "text" with a JavaScript style multi-line comment /\*\* _ text _/.

21. `annotationUpdate`

- It iterates through each .cds file.
- In each file, the function reads its content line by line. It identifies whether each line is a context definition, an annotation block, or any other line.
- For context lines, it extracts the context name and adjusts the following annotations to be prefixed with this context name.
- For annotation blocks, it updates all lines in the block, keeping track of the block start and end based on braces {}.
- All lines that are not part of a context definition or annotation block are categorized as 'other lines'.
- After processing all lines, the function constructs the new file content. It starts with 'other' lines, followed by the modified annotations.

22. `updateSchema`

- The function reads the content of the.hdbprocedure or .hdbfunction files.
- It then uses regex patterns regex2 and regex3 to find and replace specific text patterns in the file content.
- regex2 is looking for lines that contain "DEFAULT SCHEMA" and aren't commented out (don't start with --). It comments out these lines.
- regex3 is replacing any fully qualified names, (schema."entity::name"), with just the entity name ("entity::name").

23. `findFiles`

- The function takes one argument, a directory path 'dir'.
- It creates an logs output directory (outDir) within the parent folder of the input directory, if it does not already exist.
- It finds all '.cds' files within the input directory, including sub-directories and for each file, it:
  - Creates a temporary log file tmp in the system's temp directory.
  - Runs a shell command to compile the '.cds' file, redirecting any errors to the temporary log file.
  - If the tmp log file is not empty (indicating there were compilation errors), it renames and moves this file to the 'logs' folder, appending the current timestamp and '.errors.log' to the original filename.
  - If the tmp log file is empty (indicating no errors during compilation), it removes this temporary file.

24. `removeAnnotation` function deletes the annotations.cds file. Following that, it looks for and eliminates all instances where the annotation file is being used within all '.cds' files.

25. `modifyUIAnnotation` function adjusts all occurrences of UI annotations in accordance with the CAP Standards. This involves changing the first letter following the UI. prefix to uppercase. For instance, it transforms @UI.lineItem to @UI.LineItem.
